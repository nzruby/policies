# Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to the Ruby New Zealand Committee by emailing president@ruby.nz, or private messaging a commmittee member on Slack. The current list of committee members can be found [here](http://ruby.nz/current-committee).

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to contact, include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

* Your contact info for follow-up contact.
* Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
  * If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred.
  * If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a slack post or tweet) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an message from the Ruby New Zealand Committee's Code of Conduct response team acknowledging receipt as soon as possible, but within 24 hours.

The committee will meet to review the incident and determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* What kind of response is appropriate.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the committee's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the team has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no Code of Conduct violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the Code of Conduct response team to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from Slack).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Ruby New Zealand Committee spaces (events, meetings, Slack, etc.)
* A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but our response will be determined by what will be best for community safety.

## Appealing the response

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the committee, contact the Ruby New Zealand Committee with your appeal and the committee will review the case.
